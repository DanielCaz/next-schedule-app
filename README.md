A schedule that I made to have all my online class meet urls in one place. Also has a section for custom links.

It's based on my schedule but it's not too hard to adapt to other schedules.

It uses Firebase for the back-end and authentication and Next JS and Bootstrap for the front-end.

## Instructions

To Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

To Run development server (open http://localhost:3000/ on your browser to view it):

```bash
npm run dev
```

To Build For Production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Requirements

You will need to setup your own Firebase back-end.
